## Description
Implementation of substitution cipher. User's messages are converted into an .mp3 file by using a freqency to letter mapping table and sent over MQTT protocol. Client subscribers can receive the audio file and decode the message with signal processing. Another subscriber acts as a database to store these mp3 files.
